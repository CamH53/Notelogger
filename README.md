# Notelogger
A Web-based notes sharing platform made for UNCC students

## Description of the Project Background:
Students often face a common challenge of finding some good comprehensive and accessible study resources. While textbooks and lecture notes provide a solid foundation, a majority of the time we need to find supplementary materials that offer a different take on complex topics. To address this, we're developing a collaborative notes-sharing platform tailored specifically for UNC Charlotte’s students.

This platform will let students upload and share their notes with peers. By having features such as commenting and upvoting, we're creating a community-driven learning environment where the most helpful materials gain visibility. The platform will also include search and filtering options, allowing users to easily locate notes relevant to their specific courses and instructors.

Our goal is to bring a collaborative academic setting where knowledge is freely shared, and students can benefit from their peers' diverse insights. This approach not only enhances individual learning experiences but also promotes a culture of academic cooperation and mutual support.


## Scope Statement:
The project will be a reddit style web based notes sharing platform using the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The scope includes designing and implementing a user interface where students can upload, search, and filter notes based on course and professor criteria. The platform will have functionalities for users to comment on and upvote notes, ensuring the most valuable content is easily accessible. The project's codebase will be located on Github where all members can access and work on it. The development process will be with regular site testing from close friends to ensure all previously mentioned UI and functionalities work.


## Assumptions and Constraints
### Assumptions:
Team members have reliable internet access work on the project.
The scope of the project will stay the same, with no major changes.
Our stack is capable of supporting the platform’s functionality and scalability requirements.
Team members will be able to adapt and learn if they encounter a problem while building the project
Close friends who participate in user testing will provide sufficient feedback.

## Constraints:
### 13 week time limit.
Only having 3 team members to provide the same amount of work as 4.
Creating mobile support could provide too much of a challenge.
